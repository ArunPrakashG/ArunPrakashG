# Welcome, Hoomen!

Hey, I am Arun Prakash, I code for fun.
I am always looking for a challenge, to learn more, and in depth about C#.
I have done few projects, including many mini projects and 1 main project. I enjoy doing those so that i can push my knowledge in C# to another level with experience.

## My projects

* [HomeAssistant](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/HomeAssistant) - My main project, i call this one, The Long Term Project, LTP in short. My goal with this project is to rewrite its code as i get to know more about C# and .NET Core framework. I started this project as a raspberry pi application to control my room lights using a smartphone application by interfacing with a TCP Socket Server <-> Client system. Now this application can control lights with some other functionality such as a REST server instead of TCP socket, Text to speech, Entire GPIO Control with 3 drivers (RaspberryIO driver, WiringPI driver, System.Devices driver), a 'shell' utility to enter various commands, just like in a terminal, morse code generator and some more!

* [PinIndex](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/PinIndex) - Just a wrapper for api.postalpincode.in API. used for getting post offices in a locality. (INDIA)

* [OpenWeatherApiSharp](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/OpenWeatherApiSharp) - .NET Standard Wrapper library for api.openweathermap.org API. used for getting weather data of a locality.

* [qMath](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/qMath) - A work in progress libary, Goal is to provide a fluent interface for various mathamatical operations. Contains many extension methods for many types, ranging from `int` to `Tuple<>`.

* [exSharp](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/exSharp) - Contains a lot of useful extensions, personally i find it better if i have a single library for extensions which i use almost most of my time.

* [Synergy](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/Synergy) - This is a single Solution, containing multiple projects, each with their own uses.
  * [Synery.Extensions](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/Synergy/tree/master/Synergy.Extensions) - Contains Helper functions to assist with a lot of tasks, such as creating threads, running an `Action` in background etc.
  * [Synergy.Logging](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/Synergy/tree/master/Synergy.Logging) - An event based logging library which i use on my mini projects. 
  * [Synergy.PInvoke](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/Synergy/tree/master/Synergy.PInvoke) - A wrapper library for interacting with Windows Native methods, for uses such as getting point location, getting pixel color etc.
  * [Synergy.Requests](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/Synergy/tree/master/Synergy.Requests) - An HttpClient wrapper for sending requests. Has the ability to limit requests based on an internal `SemaphoreSlim`.
 
* [PushbulletCore](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/PushbulletCore) - Work in progress project, a .NET Standard wrapper for Pushbullet API.
 
* [AuthedSharp](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/AuthedSharp) - .NET Standard wrapper library for beta.authed.io API.
 
* [SystemTimeSync](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/SystemTimeSync) - A windows service application, I made this to act as a workaround for system time sync error on latest windows build (v2004). The service will start automatically on system startup and connects with time.windows.com NTP server and forcefully syncs the system time with the one received from the NTP server.
 
* [DirectoryZync](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/DirectoryZync) - Work in progress, Sync between two directories in your PC, sync the files, and subfolders, create backup copies of a directory.
 
* [DisableWindowsService](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/DisableWindowsService) - Command line utility to disable windows services. Supports startup arguments and runs the disabling process parallely for each service.
 
* [GSTValidator](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/GSTValidator) - Console application to search GST Practitioners. (INDIA)
 
* [BulkMailer](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/BulkMailer) - Send emails in bulk from an account. Made for just a small purpose, Use this at your own risk as gmail might flag your account for spam.

* [SteamBanChecker](https://github.com/ArunPrakashG/SteamBanChecker) - Checks ban status on steam accounts in bulk.
