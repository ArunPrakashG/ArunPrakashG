<p align="center">In this vast universe of code, I've been fortunate to work with some of the brightest stars in the tech constellation. As Carl Sagan said, <i>"The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself."</i> Each technology I've encountered has enriched my journey, echoing the words of Sir Isaac Newton: <i>"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants."</i></p>

<p align="center">Thank you for stopping by, fellow explorer. In the words of Stephen Hawking, <i>"Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Be curious, and however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at."</i> May the code be with you! ðŸŒ </p>
